<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This task extracts a number of different XRT light curves from a series of
Swift gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations. It does so using a wide variety of
HEASoft/Swift tasks, and relatively few inputs. It was designed to automate the
somewhat cumbersome task of extracting a corrected, flux converted light curve
from a potentially large set of Swift observations.

<p>The process of extracting such a light curve observation is complicated by
several factors:

<ul>
<li>
GRBs always fade and sometimes flare. So simply choosing a circular region for
the source light curve, and an annulus for the background, as is the usual
practice, may produce erroneous results.</li>
<li>
GRBs can be bright, so CCD pileup must be accounted for. However, since they
also fade and flare, pileup must be accounted for in a time-dependent
manner.</li>
<li>
The Swift XRT automatically switches between Windowed Timing mode (WT) and
Photon Counting mode (PC), depending on the count rate of the source. Each mode
requires a slightly different set of reduction and light curve extraction
techniques.</li>
<li>
GRBs often evolve spectrally over time, so converting count rates to flux units
must be done in a time-dependent manner.</li>
<li>
Swift is in Low-Earth orbit. Observations of a single GRB may span numerous
orbits, and the spacecraft attitude can and does change from one orbit to the
next.</li>
</ul>

<p>To account for the above complications, this task is split into several
main steps, described below.

<h3>Extraction Region Determination</h3>

<p>First, the cleaned event data are separated by mode - either PC or WT.
The PC mode event lists are combined into a single image, and a sliding cell
detection (XImage detect) is run to detect both the GRB and any field sources
in the field of view.  Negative circular regions are generated for each field
source, with radii equal to twice the half-box radius reported by XImage. The
GRB source position is refined using xrtcentroid on this combined PC image, if
asked to by the user.  Spacecraft orbit separations are determined by running
<code>maketime</code> on the input makefilter files, and selecting on the
SETTLED, TEN_ARCMIN, VRD1 and ANG_DIST columns (see <code>maketimeexpr</code>
parameter).

<p>Next, the source and background light curve extraction regions are
determined.  For each orbit of the PC mode data, a light curve with 20 second
time bins is extracted from a circular region of radius 40'' centered on the
GRB. For each orbit of the WT mode data, a light curve with 4 second time bins
is extracted from a box 15'' wide and 50'' long, rotated to match the
spacecraft roll angle at the end of the orbit (i.e. aligned along the WT
strip). 

<p>There are two methods that can be used to then determine the extraction
regions from these preliminary light curves.  First, if
<code>splitorbits='yes'</code>, and the Chi-Squared probability that the
preliminary light curve is constant is &lt; 15%, a sliding-cell type algorithm
is applied to the light curves which chooses source and background regions based
on the weighted average count rate in a fixed number of non-zero bins (10 at
the moment). The time duration that a certain region covers grows or shrinks,
depending on how the count rate changes. If, on the other hand, the preliminary
light curve is deemed to be constant, then the mean count rate for that orbit
is used.

<p>If <code>splitorbits='no'</code>, then there is no sub-orbit interval
splitting. If the light curve for this orbit is constant (see above), the
region corresponding to the mean count rate is used. If the orbit light curve
is not constant then the region corresponding to the maximum count rate in the
orbit is used. This is done to allow for pileup to be properly accounted for in
orbits that have high variability.

<p>The count-rate dependent regions are as follows (cr=weighted mean count rate
for sliding-cell, cr=mean count rate for roughly constant curve, cr=max count
rate for <code>splitorbits='no'</code> and non-constant curve). There are two lists of regions for each of the PC and WT modes, and these lists can be selected by the user with the <code>pcreglist</code> and <code>wtreglist</code> parameters. The regions that differ between the two lists are indicated by a double asterisk (**).:

<h3>Light Curve Extraction and Correction</h3>

<p>Once the extraction regions and corresponding time ranges are determined,
source and background unbinned light curve, spectrum, event list and total
counts are extracted for each region. An exposure map is also generated for
each interval. The source and background exposure corrections are calculated as
the ratio of the nominal exposure time to the mean exposure time per pixel in
each region. If there are any counts in the full band (see the
<code>minenergy</code>, <code>maxenergy</code> and <code>splitenergy</code>
parameters), then to get PSF corrected rates, two ARFs are generated - one with
the PSF correction applied and weighted by the exposure map, and one with
neither correction. If the source is detected (see the <code>detthresh</code>
parameter), a double absorbed power law is then fit to the extracted spectrum,
using both the PSF corrected, and non-PSF corrected ARFs. Galactic nH is
assumed (and fixed) in the fit (see <code>nhmap</code> and <code>usernh</code>
parameters).

<p>If <code>psfcorrmeth='xspec'</code>, then the ratio of the power-law
normalizations gives the PSF correction.  If
<code>psfcorrmeth='xrtlccorr'</code>, then the
task <code>xrtlccorr</code> is run on the light curve and event file
for this interval to get the correction.  Additionally, a mean
correction or a time-dependent correction can be selected using
the <code>lccorravg</code> parameter.  In
either <code>psfcorrmeth</code> case, the energy conversion factor is
calculated using the model flux from the fitted spectrum, after
setting the absorption terms to zero.
 
<p>If this fit fails, or the source is not detected then the previously derived
value for the flux conversion is used, and the PSF correction is taken as the
average ratio of the PSF to non-PSF corrected spectral responses (no weighting
applied). This is justified by the fact that if the fit fails, it is likely due
to lack of spectral information, so any PSF correction will be an estimate
anyway. If however, there is no previous good spectral fit, then the mean GRB
flux conversion of 5e-11erg/cm**2/count is used.

<p>The background subtracted light curve is converted to both corrected count
rate, as well as flux using the per-interval conversion factors determined
above. The synchronous raw rate, net light curve (source - background),
corrected light curve, flux light curve and scaled background light curve are 
saved to single FITS file for each mode.

<h3>Binning and Hardness Ratios</h3>
<p>Binning can be done in two ways (or not at all - see <code>bincurve</code>
parameter). The first way is binning stricly on counts
(<code>bintype=0</code>), whereby the raw light curve is binned to a minimum of
<code>minbincnts</code> counts per bin. The binning algorithm will try not to
cross what are considered gaps in the GTI coverage. This gap interval can be
customized with the <code>gapintv</code> parameter, which is specified in
seconds. If there are not enough counts to make a bin between gaps, then gaps
may be spanned by time bins. If the algorithm is not able to make a bin from an
orbit, but the previous and following orbits do have good bins, then either the
bin will be dropped (<code>cutlowbins=yes</code>), or the low count bin will be
included in the final products (<code>cutlowbins=no</code>).

<p>The second binning method (<code>bintype=1</code>) is a step-binning one,
where the number of counts per bin depends on the net rate (source - scaled
background), and the signal-to-noise in that bin. The rates and corresponding
counts per bin can be specified using the <code>pcsteprates</code> and
<code>wtsteprates</code> parameters. These are comma separated lists of
"&lt;max rate&gt;:&lt;counts/bin&gt; pairs. If the rate is less than or equal
to &lt;max rate&gt;, then &lt;counts/bin&gt; will be used for that bin. Every
time a count is added to a bin, the bin rate, and signal-to-noise are checked,
and the required counts for that bin adjusted accordingly. The same rules for
gaps and the gap interval as above apply to this method also, except that the
gaps are only spanned if there are neither enough counts nor enough
signal-to-noise.

<p> For either method, if there are counts left over at the end of the light
curves that cannot make a bin, and the signal to noise of the remaining interval
is below <code>detthresh</code>, an upper limit is found for the remaining
time. This is a Bayesian upper limit as described in Physical Review D 54, 1991
page 166 equation 28.40. See the NOTE below for an explanation of how these
are indicated in the FITS light curves.

<p>After applying either of the above methods, the bin boundaries are then 
applied to the net, corrected, flux, and background light curves. If band 
splitting is requested, then the binning method is only applied to the hard
band, and those bins are applied both to the hard and soft curves. This is
done, since in general, there will be more soft photons detected than hard, and
the bins need to match to get a hardness ratio.  The hardness ratio is simply
then calculated as the ratio of corrected hard rate to corrected soft rate.

If binning is requested, there will be another extension in the output FITS
light curves, with EXTNAME='RATEBIN'. The column names and descriptions (see
OUTPUT below), are identical to those for the unbinned light curves in the
EXTNAME='RATE' extension.

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

<h3>File Format</h3>
<p>The FITS light curves have the following columns in the 'RATE'
extension and, if binning is requested, the 'RATEBIN' extension:

<p>
<dl>
    <dt>TIME, XAX_E, TIMEDEL, FRACEXP
    <dd>Standard timing data columns

    <dt>RATERAW, ERRORRAW
    <dd>Raw (non-background subtracted) rate and error

    <dt>RATENET, ERRORNET
    <dd>Net (source - scaled background) rate and error
    
    <dt>RATECOR, ERRORCOR
    <dd>Corrected rate and error
    
    <dt>RATEFLUX, ERRORFLUX
    <dd>Flux rate and error

    <dt>RATEBKG, ERRORBKG
    <dd>Scaled background rate and error

</dl>

<p>If band splitting is specified there will be a light curve for
each band as above. If binning is also done, there will be a single light curve
containing both the binned hard curves, and the binned soft curves, as well as
the hardness ratio. The soft band columns are named as above, except that each
column name has a "1" as a suffix. A similar thing is done for the hard band
columns, with "2" as the suffix. The hardness ratio column, and respective
error column are named RATIO and RATIOERROR respectively.

<p>Each light curve will also have a GTI extension, indicating the Good Time
Intervals used in the light curve extraction.

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Upper limits are indicated (at the time of this
writing) by a NULL or INDEF in all of the ERROR* columns (except ERRORBKG). In
this case the RATE* columns indicate the <code>detthresh</code>-sigma Bayesian
upper limit.

<h3>Filenames, etc.</h3>
<p>The number of output files depends on both the <code>clean</code> and
<code>splitenergy</code> parameters. The minimum set of output files occurs
when <code>clean='yes'</code> and <code>splitenergy&lt;=0.0</code>. As an
example, if <code>outdir=./test</code>, <code>outstem=GRBTEST</code>,
<code>minenergy</code>, and <code>maxenergy</code> are 0.3, and 10.0
respectively, then the minimum set of output files would be:

<dl>
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpcetsra.lc</code>
    <dd>PC mode source light curves (0.3-10 keV)
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpcetsr.pha</code>
    <dd>Average PC mode source PHA
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpcetbg.pha</code>
    <dd>Average PC mode background PHA
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpcet.arf</code>
    <dd>Weighted average PC mode ARF
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwtetsra.lc</code>
    <dd>WT mode source light curves (0.3-10 keV)
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwtetsr.pha</code>
    <dd>Average WT mode source PHA
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwtetbg.pha</code>
    <dd>Average WT mode background PHA
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwtet.arf</code>
    <dd>Weighted average WT mode ARF
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_info.fits</code>
    <dd>FITS table containing light curve, spectral, detection and region information
</dl>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>There may be more than one source and background
spectrum for each mode. This can happen if the input event files for a given
mode were filtered using different GRADE selections, or if the substrate
voltage is different between the event files. In either case, the proper RMF
will be different, neccessitating separate PHA files. The files will be
numbered (e.g.  <code>GRBTEST_xpcetsr1.pha</code>) if and only if there is more
than one PHA for that mode. Otherwise, the above convention will be used.

<p>If energy band splitting is requested, with <code>splitenergy=2.0</code>,
there will be corresponding the following additional files:

<dl>
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpce1sra.lc</code>
    <dd>PC mode source light curves (0.3-2 keV)
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwte2sra.lc</code>
    <dd>WT mode source light curves (2-10 keV)
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xpcetsrrb.lc</code>
    <dd>binned PC mode hardness ratio time series
    
    <dt><code>./test/GRBTEST_xwtetsrrb.lc</code>
    <dd>binned WT mode hardness ratio time series
</dl>

<p>Lastly, if <code>clean='no'</code>, then most intermediate files will not be
removed, and if <code>cleanspec='no'</code> then files needed for the followup
task <code>xrtgrblcspec</code> will not be removed. The list of files is too
long to list here, but the filenames should be fairly self-explanatory
(although they may not be).


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>evtfiles [filename]

    <dd>List of cleaned event files to extract light curve from. This can
    either be a comma separated list of event files, or the name of a text file
    containing a list of filenames (one per line) preceded by an '@' character.
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>These should have been processed with the
    <code>xrtpipeline</code> task, specifying the (RA, Dec) of the GRB.
    Otherwise, for WT mode, <code>xrtgrblc</code> may not correctly identify
    the GRB.

    <p>
    <dt>mkffiles [filename]

    <dd>List of makefilter files (e.g. sw00000000000s.mkf), one for each
    cleaned event file. This can either be a comma separated list of files, or
    the name of a text file containing a list of filenames (one per line)
    preceded by an '@' character. These should be the makefilter files produced
    by xrtpipeline.

    <p>
    <dt>xhdfiles [filename]

    <dd>List of XRT header housekeeping files (e.g. sw00000000000xhd.hk), one
    for each clean event file. This can either be a comma separated list of
    files, or the name of a text file containing a list of filenames (one per
    line) preceded by an '@' character. These are typically found in the xrt/hk
    subdirectory of an observation

    <p>
    <dt>attfiles [filename]

    <dd>List of Swift attitude files (e.g. sw00000000000sat.fits), one for each
    clean event file. This can either be a comma separated list of files, or
    the name of a text file containing a list of filenames (one per line)
    preceded by an '@' character. These are typically found in the auxil
    subdirectory of an observation.

    <p>
    <dt>outdir [filename]

    <dd>Output directory used for writing light curves, as well as various
    scripts and intermediate files (of which there are many). If
    <code>clobber</code> is not set, and this directory already exists, the
    task will fail.
    <p>
    <strong>CAUTION: If <code>clobber</code> is set, and this directory already
        exists, then this task will overwrite files as needed in this directory.
    </strong>

    <p>
    <dt>outstem [string]

    <dd>This is the base name for all output files.

    <p>
    <dt>srcra [HH:MM:SS.SS, HH MM SS.SS or DDD.DD]

    <dd>RA of the GRB. The more accurate this is, the better.

    <p>
    <dt>srcdec [DD:MM:SS.SS, DD MM SS.SS or DDD.DD]

    <dd>Dec of the GRB.

    <p>
    <dt>psfcorrmeth (xspec|xrtlccorr) [string]

    <dd>Method to use to get PSF corrections for each interval. If
    <code>xspec</code>, then the PSF correction is found using the ratio of
    Xspec fit normalizations for each interval. If <code>xrtlccorr</code>, then
    the task <code>xrtlccorr</code> is used to determine the PSF correction for
    each interval (see fhelp xrtlccorr). 

    <p>
    <dt>lccorravg [bool]

    <dd>Use a mean PSF correction when psfcorrmeth = 'xrtlccorr'? If
    set to 'yes', <code>xrtlccorr</code> will be run
    with <code>createinstrmap = no</code>, and a single PSF correction
    factor will be calculated for and applied to each orbit's light
    curve.  When set to 'no', <code>xrtlccorr</code> will be run with
    <code>createinstrmap = yes</code>, <code>pcnframe = 4</code>,
    and <code>wtnframe = 10</code>, and a time-dependent PSF
    correction factor will be applied to each orbit's light curve.
    Using the time-dependent PSF correction factor may be more
    accurate in times when the attitude has not stabilized but
    requires more processing time to calculate. The lccorravg
    parameter has no effect when psfcorrmeth is not set to
    'xrtlccorr'.

    <p>
    <dt>object [string]

    <dd>Object name, or DEFAULT to use OBJECT keyword from input event files.
    This will be written to the OBJECT keywords in the output data.

    <p>
    <dt>(usecentroid) [bool]

    RA/Dec for <code>xrtcentroid</code> will be taken from the
    <code>srcra</code> and <code>srcdec</code> parameters.

    <p>
    <dt>centroidhbox [real]

    <dd>Half-box width of <code>xrtcentroid</code> box, in arcminutes. This
    is only queried if <code>usecentroid</code> is 'yes'.

    <p>
    <dt>(detthresh) [float]

    <dd>Detection threshold (sigma). If signal to noise in a given interval is
    below this level, data from the corresponding time range will not be
    included in the final products.

    <p>
    <dt>(fldsrcdist) [float (degrees)]

    <dd>Minimum distance in degrees from input RA/Dec (or centroided RA/Dec if
    <code>usecentroid</code> is set to 'yes') for a detected field source to be
    considered a field source.

    <p>
    <dt>(minpccnts) [float]

    <dd>Minimum PC mode raw counts required for spectral analysis of each
    interval.  If a PC mode interval has less than <code>minpccnts</code>
    counts, the flux conversion and PSF correction will be treated as if the
    spectral fit failed (see <strong>Light Curve Extraction and Correction</strong>)

    <p>
    <dt>(minwtcnts) [float]

    <dd>Minimum WT mode raw counts required for spectral analysis of each
    interval.  If a WT mode interval has less than <code>minwtcnts</code>
    counts, the flux conversion and PSF correction will be treated as if the
    spectral fit failed (see <strong>Light Curve Extraction and Correction</strong>)

    <p>
    <dt>(pcreglist) (1-2) [int]

    <p>
    <dt>(pcframetime) [float]

    <dd>Time bin duration for "unbinned" PC mode light curves. If &lt;= 0.0,
    the FRAMTIME or TIMEDEL keyword from input event files will be used.

    <p>
    <dt>(wtframetime) [float]

    <dd>Time bin duration for "unbinned" WT mode light curves. If &lt;= 0.0,
    the FRAMTIME or TIMEDEL keyword from input event files will be used. You
    should note that the WT mode frame time is ~1e-3, so the unbinned light
    curves may be large if this parameter is set to 0.0. Also, the unbinned
    light curves will likely not be well sampled at all.
    
    <p>
    <dt>minenergy [float]

    <dd>The minimum energy in keV to consider in generating the light curves.

    <p>
    <dt>maxenergy [float]

    splitting will be done. If binning is also requested (see

    the ratio of the binned, corrected count rate from <code>splitenergy</code>
    to <code>maxenergy</code> to the binned, corrected count rate from
    <code>minenergy</code> to <code>splitenergy</code>. The binning for
    hard/soft bands is done only on the hard band, then the bins are applied to

    <dd>If set to 'no', then extraction regions, psf corrections, and flux
    conversions will be done on a per-orbit basis. If set to 'yes', each orbit
    may be split into sub-orbit intervals, based on count rate (see way above).

    <p>
    <dt>(maketimeexpr) [string]

    <dd>This is the expression used to determine spacecraft orbits. It is
    unlikely that the user will need or want to change this. In fact, changing
    this parameter might lead to erroneous results, particularly with WT mode

    This would then bin the curves to 20 count/bin if the rate is &lt;= 1.0,
    30 count/bin if the rate is &gt; 1.0 and &lt;= 2.0, etc.

    <p>
    <dt>wtsteprates [string]

    <dd>WT mode step binning max rate/count per bin pairs. See the
    <code>pcsteprates</code> parameter.

    <p>
    <dt>cutlowbins [bool]

    <dd>Cut bins that are below <code>minbincts</code> per bin? If set to 'no',
    and either <code>cutlowbinspc</code> or <code>cutlowbinswt</code> is set to
    'yes', then low bins will only be cut in specific modes. If set to 'yes',
    then all low bins will be cut. Only queried if <code>bincurve</code> is
    'yes'.

    <p>
    <dt>cutlowbinspc [bool]

    <dd>Cut PC mode bins that are below <code>minbincts</code> per bin? Only
    queried if <code>bincurve</code> is 'yes'.

    to use a per-interval power-law fit instead. 

    <p>
    <dt>(usetrigtime) [bool]

    <dd>Offset light curves by TRIGTIME? If set to yes, then all output light
    curves will be offset by the either the value of the <code>trigtime</code>
    parameter (if &gt; 0), or by the first TRIGTIME keyword encountered in the
    input event files. If set to 'no', then the output lightcurves will be
