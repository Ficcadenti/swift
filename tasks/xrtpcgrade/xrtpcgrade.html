<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtpcgrade -- Calculates the PHA values and assigns event grades.
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtpcgrade infile outfile [parameter=value ... ]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'xrtpcgrade' calculates the PHA values and assigns the grades for 
the Swift XRT Photon Counting (PC) mode data. 
<br>
In PC mode each event has nine PHA values associated, stored 
in the column PHAS, corresponding to an array of 3x3 pixels,
the central pixel and eight surrounding pixels.
'xrtpcgrade'  reads the nine elements of the PHAS column, calculates a single 
PHA value for each  event and writes the result in the PHA column of the output file. 
The PHA value is calculated by summing all the pixels with values above the split 
threshold. If the parameter 'thrfile' is set to CALDB, 'xrtpcgrade' reads the
split threshold value stored in the calibration database file.
By setting 'thrfile' to NONE, the task allows the user to set the split
threshold using the parameter 'split'. 
The number of pixels above the split threshold is stored in the column named PixsAbove. 
The grade values are written in the GRADE column of the output file. 
All other columns of the EVENTS and the GTI extensions of the input file are 
copied unchanged to the output file. 
<br>
The grades for the PC mode are assigned following a pattern definition 
stored in a CALDB file.
The task also allows the user to assign also grades following the ASCA convention if the
option 'ascagrade' is set to 'yes'. In this case the grade definition 
is done using the routine  originally  developed for the ASCA task 'faint'.
The routine ignores the corner pixels in the computation of the PHA value, 
except in the case of grade 6 where a corner pixel is included.
The results of this computation  are included in the two columns ASCAPHA and 
ASCAGRADE. This option is included only for comparison purposes and, if 
selected, the XRT and ASCA grades are both included in the output file.
Grade selection for the Swift XRT  PC  data should be done  
using the XRT pattern convention.
<br>
'xrtpcgrade' add the Data Subspace keywords in the header of the event file
 to record the event grade (DSVALn, DSTYPn, DSFORMn). These keywords are 
updated by other tasks to record the screening on grades.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>infile [file name]
<dd>Name  of  the  input event FITS file. Unix-compressed files are allowed,
except when the output file is set to NONE and the input file is overwritten.
<p>        
<dt>hdfile [file name]
<dd>Name of the input Housekeeping Header Packets FITS file.
<p>        
<dt>outfile [file name]
<dd>Name of output event FITS file. The value 'NONE' will cause the input file to be overwritten.
<p>    
<dt>(gradefile = CALDB )[file name]
<dd>Name of input GRADE file. If set to CALDB (default), use the file in the Calibration Database
<p>
<dt>thrfile [file name]
<dd>Name of the input file containing split threshold values as a function of
the CCD substrate voltage. If the parameter is set to CALDB, the file is read 
from the calibration database. If the parameter is set to NONE, the split threshold 
value must be input via the parameter 'split'.
<p>
<dt>(split = -1) [integer]
<dd>Split threshold level. If set to a negative value, use the on-board
split threshold values read from the input hdfile 'SplitThr' column. 
This parameter is used only if 'thrfile' is set to NONE.
<p>
<dt>(ascagrade = no) [boolean]
<dd> If ascragrade=yes  the grades are calculated according to the ASCA patterns. 
The results are written in the 'ASCAPHA' and 'ASCAGRADE' columns.
<p>
<dt>(history=yes) [boolean]
<dd>If set to yes, write parameter values and other information in HISTORY blocks.
<p>
<dt>(clobber=no) [boolean]
<dd>If 'clobber'=yes and outfile=filename, the file with the same name
    will be  overwritten, if it exists.
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer]
<dd>Chatter Level (min=0, max=5).
</dl>    
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<ol>
<li>Calculate PHA and GRADE values for the Photon Counting mode event file
    sw00073232001xpcwnpouf.evt using the split threshold value stored in the 
    CALDB file, assign also grades according to the ASCA 
    convention (ASCAPHA and ASCAGRADE columns) and write the output in the 
    file 'outfile.fits'.
