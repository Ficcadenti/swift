<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtevtrec -- Reconstruct events, calculate PHA and assign grade for the WT and PD modes
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtevtrec infile outfile [parameter=<value>]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
'xrtevtrec' processes the Swift XRT event files containing data taken with the
Windowed Timing (WT) and Photodiode (PD)  modes to reconstruct events, calculate their PHA 
values and assign to each one a grade.
<br>
The event reconstruction is carried out by searching for the local maximun in the 
neighborhood of a 7x1 pixel array.
The PHA value of a 'reconstructed' event is obtained by summing up the PHA of the central 
pixel to that of the surrounding pixels above the split threshold and the result 
is written in the PHA column. The event grade is assigned using pre-defined patterns 
for the charge distribution and its value is stored in the column GRADE.
A calibration file included in CALDB contains the charge distribution patterns 
of the different grades. 
<br>

If the parameter 'addcol' is set to 'yes',  the columns PHAS, containing the
7x1 pixel array used for the event reconstruction, and PixsAbove, containing the number 
of pixels above split threshold, are added to the output file. All the other 
columns present in the events extension of the input file are copied to the output 
file. The original PHA value of each pixel is copied into 
a column named EVTPHA. 

<br>
After the event reconstruction only a subset of pixels is recognized as event.
All pixels associated with a local maximum that have contributed to the 
reconstruction of one event have the GRADE and PHA columns assigned to NULL.
These pixels are by default kept in the output file. However it is possible 
to exclude them from the output by setting the parameter 'delnull' to 'yes'.
<br>
If the parameter 'thrfile' is set to CALDB, 'xrtevtrec' reads the event and 
split threshold values stored in the calibration database file. 
By setting 'thrfile' to NONE, the task allows the user to set event and split 
thresholds using the parameters 'event' and 'split'. 
<br>
In addition for the Windowed Timing mode, 
it is possible to flag a reconstructed event for which the 7x1 pixel array 
contains a bad column.
This is obtained by setting the parameter 'flagneigh' to yes and causes 
the column STATUS to be updated.
<br>
'xrtevrec' adds the keyword XRTEVREC in the file header set to 'T' to indicate 
that the event reconstruction has been done. The values of the event threshold and 
split threshold used in the calculation are recorded in the keywords 
XRTEVTHR and XRTSPLIT. The percentage of saturated events, the percentage of pixel 
not included in the reconstruction and the percentage of pixel with PHA set to NULL 
are recorded in the keywords  XRTSATEV, XRTNOREC, XRTNULEV respectively. 
The Data Subspace convention (DS keywords) recording the event grade values present 
in the file (DSVALn, DSTYPn, DSFORMn ) are also added to the output file.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>infile [file name]
<dd>Name of the input event FITS file. Unix-compressed files are allowed,
except when the output file is set to NONE and the input file is overwritten.
<p> 
<dt>hdfile  [file name]
<dd>Name of the input Housekeeping Header Packets FITS file.        
<p>
<dt>outfile [file name]
<dd> Name of output event FITS file. The value 'NONE' will cause the input file to be overwritten.
<p>
<dt>(gradefile=CALDB) [file name]
<dd>Name of the grade file. If the parameters is set to CALDB, the file
is read from the calibration database.
<p>
<dt>thrfile [file name]
<dd>Name of the input file containing event and split threshold values as a function of 
the CCD substrate voltage. If the parameter is set to CALDB, the file is read from the calibration 
database. If the parameter is set to NONE, the event and split threshold values must be input 
via the parameters 'event' and 'split'. 
<p>
<dt>(addcol=no) [boolean]
<dd> If set to 'yes', adds 'PHAS' and 'PixsAbove' columns.
<p>
<dt>(delnull=no) [boolean]
<dd>If set to 'yes', deletes NULL events.
<p>
<dt>(flagneigh = no) [boolean]
<dd>If set to 'yes' the STATUS column will be updated.
<p>
<dt>event [integer]
<dd>Event Threshold Level. If negative the hdfile 'EvtLLD' column values are used. 
This parameter is used only if 'thrfile' is set to NONE.
<p>
<dt>split [integer]
<dd>Split Threshold Level. If negative the hdfile 'EvtLLD' column values are used.
This parameter is used only if 'thrfile' is set to NONE.
<p>
<dt>(clobber=no) [boolean]
<dd>Overwrite the output file if it is set to 'yes'.
<p>
<dt>(history=yes) [boolean]
<dd>If set to 'yes', writes parameter values and other information in HISTORY blocks
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer]
<dd>Chatter Level (min=0, max=5)
</dl>    
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<ol>
<li>Recontruct events for the WT event file 'sw00111063000xlrb1po_uf.evt' using an event threshold of 70
 and a split threshold of 40. Write the output in the file 'outfile.fits'.
<p>
<pre>xrtevtrec  infile=sw00111063000xlrb1po_uf.evt hdfile=sw00111063000xhd.hk  
thrfile=NONE event=70 split=40 outfile=outfile.fits
