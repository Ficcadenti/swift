<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtcalcpi -- Calculate PI column values of XRT event files (PC, WT and PD modes) 
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtcalcpi  infile  outfile hdfile [parameter =<value>] </tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'xrtcalcpi' calculates the Pulse Invariant (PI) values of Swift XRT event files
for data obtained with the Photon Counting (PC), Windowed Timing (WT) and Photodiode 
(PD) readout modes. The PI values are corrected for average positional gain variation 
(Charge Transfer Inefficiency, CTI) and for changes of the gain with 
temperature and time. 
Moreover, the charge loss due to a single bad pixel (a "charge trap") within a column of the CCD
can also be corrected by the task.
The PI column as well as the keyword XRTPI in the output file are updated by this task.</br>
<p>
By setting the parameter 'corrtype' to 'NOMINAL', the 'xrtcalcpi' task calculates the PI values 
using the PHA values, stored in the PHA column of the input event file, the gain and a set of coefficients 
describing the average spatial dependence of the gain. The coefficient values have been 
evaluated from on-ground calibration data at three fixed temperature of the CCD
and are periodically updated using the results of the in-flight calibration data analysis.
</br> 
The gain information is stored in the XRT calibration gain files which are included in CALDB. 
There is one similarly formatted gain calibration file for each readout mode.
The coefficients describing the gain and its average spatial dependence for the three temperatures values 
are stored in the arrays GC0 - GC5 of the FITS files in CALDB. 
The GC1 and GC2 coefficients are energy 
dependent following a broken power-law model with indices 'beta1' and 'beta2' and break 
energy value, in PI units, 'ecti'.  By default, the values of 'beta1', 'beta2' and 'ecti' are read from 
the CALB gain files. The user may specify in input their values by setting the parameter 'userctipar' to 'yes'.
</br>
The PI values calculation is the result of an interpolation on temperature and on time.
First, for each event the two rows valid for the epochs closest to the time of the 
observation are chosen. Then for each row, given the temperature of the frame, 
the task performs a temperature interpolation of the gain coefficients between 
the two nearest temperatures to the one of the frame, thus obtaining two sets
of  coefficients for two contiguous timestamps.
Finally, a second interpolation with respect to time between these two sets of 
coefficients is performed. 
<p> 
By setting the parameter 'corrtype' to 'TOTAL' (default), in addition to the PI calculation described above, 
the task also applies a specific column to column correction to account for the effect of the charge traps. This 
correction is calculated by adding an energy offset to the events falling within column segments affected 
by a charge loss due to a trap. A broken power-law energy dependence for the charge trap correction is 
also applied by the task. The energy offset is calculated through an iterative algorithm with the number of 
steps set by the parameter 'offsetniter' value.
</br>
The charge traps information (location on the CCD, offset, energy dependence) is stored 
in the XRT calibration gain files included in CALDB. Optionally (parameter 'userctcorrpar=yes'), the 
broken power-law energy dependence of the charge trap correction can be supplied by the user through 
the parameters 'alpha1', 'alpha2' and 'ebreak'. 
</br>
Note that when this correction is applied, the task uses a different set of GC coefficients (GC0_TRAP, GC1_TRAP, 
GC2_TRAP, GC3_TRAP, GC4_TRAP, GC5_TRAP) and a different set of parameters for the GC1/GC2 energy dependence 
(BETA1_TRAP, BETA2_TRAP, E_CTI_TRAP) read from the CALDB gain files.
<p>
The task allows to store in a specific column (PI_NOM) of the output event file the PI values obtained 
without the charge traps correction (parameter 'savepinom' set to 'yes').
<p>
'xrtcalcpi' by default uses the XRT gain file, appropriate  for each mode, stored 
in CALDB, but it can be replaced with an input gain file supplied by the user 
(parameter 'gainfile'). The user-provided gain file must have the 
same format as the XRT gain file in the Calibration Database.</br>
<p> 
The algorithm describing the spatial dependence of gain is expressed in raw 
coordinates, RAWX and RAWY.
For the timing modes (WT and PD), for which the telemetry does not contain complete 
spatial information, 'xrtcalcpi' accounts for the positional gain correction assuming 
all events at the source location. 
For the WT mode, the RAWX coordinate of the event is known and
the RAWY is obtained by transforming the DETY column value.
For the Photodiode mode the event detector coordinates are read from the 
DETX/DETY columns of the event file and transformed in RAWX/RAWY.
<p>   
The unit of the PI column is set to 10 eV per channel.
Users can adjust the PI values via the parameter 'offset' and 'gainnom'. 
These values can be obtained with the XSPEC command 'gain' that provides a 
slope and a constant. The parameter 'offset' should be set equal to the
constant obtained by the XSPEC 'gain' command and the parameter 'gainnom' should be set 
equal to the slope obtained by the XSPEC 'gain' command multiplied by the default value of
eV per channel (10).
