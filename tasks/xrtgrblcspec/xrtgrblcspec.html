<h2>NAME</h2>

xrtgrblcspec - Swift XRT GRB light curve fitting/spectral analysis task

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<code>xrtgrblcspec indir=&lt;output&nbsp;from&nbsp;xrtgrblc&gt;
    instem=&lt;stem name&gt; outdir=&lt;output&nbsp;dir&gt;
    outstem=&lt;stem&nbsp;for&nbsp;output&nbsp;files&gt; srcra=&lt;source RA&gt;
    srcdec=&lt;source Dec&gt;
</code>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This task is a direct follow-up task for xrtgrblc. It is designed to work
with the output files from that task, when the option
<code>cleanspec='no'</code> (intermediate spectra, events, and ARF
files are not cleaned). This task does basically has two stages: 1 - Determine
time intervals to extract spectra from; 2 - Extract and possibly fit those spectra.

<p>The first stage is done by attempting to fit the output light curves from
xrtgrblc. Three models are tried in Xspec - power, bknpower, and bkn2po using
initial guesses determined from the light curves themselves. The best fit is
chosen by way of a series of F-tests. If running with interactive='yes', then
the user is prompted whether they like the fit, and are allowed to fit the
light curve manually if not, or just enter time intervals for spectrum
extractions.

<p>The second stage takes the time intervals from the first stage, determines
how to extract a source and background spectrum, then does so. If requested,
the extracted spectra are fit with an absorbed power-law model, and plotted to
the requested plot device (file-devices only).

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<p>The output from this task is a set of source PHA files, one for each time
interval found (and split on XRTVSUB changes if neccessary), and the
corresponding background PHA and PSF corrected ARF. They are named as follows:

<dl>
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrt[1-3].pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode interval source spectra for intervals 1-3 (maximally)

    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetbgt[1-3].pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode interval background spectra for intervals 1-3 (maximally)

    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrt[1-3].arf</code>
    <dd>PC mode interval ARF for intervals 1-3 (maximally)

    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrtt.pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode total source spectrum (excluding any user excluded time intervals)
    
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetbgtt.pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode total background spectrum (excluding any user excluded time intervals)
    
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrtt.arf</code>
    <dd>PC mode total ARF
</dl>

<p>where OUTSTEM is the value of the parameter <code>outstem</code>. There
would be a similar set of files for WT mode, although this depends on which
modes are active during which intervals (and if there are "enough" counts - see
<code>minpcphacts</code> and <code>minwtphacts</code> params). If there are
different RMF requirements for a single mode (PC/WT) during an interval, the
PHA's will be split accordingly, with the last character before the file
extension being [a-z].

<p>For example, if the first PC interval requires two RMFs (say, due to a
change in the substrate voltage), there would be the following set of PHA's for
the first interval (not shown are the corresponding bkg spectra and the ARFS):

<dl>
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrt1.pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode interval source spectra for interval 1, first RMF

    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpcetsrt1a.pha</code>
    <dd>PC mode interval source spectra for interval 1, second RMF
</dl>

<p>In addition, if <code>autospecfit='yes'</code>, for each interval (including
the total), there will be a plot generated of the fitted spectrum:

<dl>
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpwetsrt[1-3t]_ph.gif</code>
    <dd>PC/WT mode interval spectrum plot. The file extension will be based on
    the <code>plotftype</code> parameter.
</dl>

<p>Lastly, there will be a plot of the fitted light curve, either the best
automatically fitted light curve, or the user fit light curve:

<dl>
    <dt><code>outdir/OUTSTEM_xpwetsrmb_lc.gif</code>
    <dd>PC/WT mode fitted light curve plot. The file extension will be based on
    the <code>plotftype</code> parameter.
</dl>

<h2>INTERACTIVE MODE</h2>
<p>If <code>interactive='yes'</code>, the light curve automatic fitting is
performed, and the best fit is chosen by way of a series of F-tests. The user
is then prompted for a QDP plot device, and the best-fit light curve is plotted
there. The user is then prompted if they think the fit is acceptable. If they
do not, an interactive Xspec session (Xspec v12) is started with the PC and WT
fittable light curves preloaded (PC is dataset 1, and WT is dataset 2, if both
are extant).

<p>At this point the user has three options. First, they can fit the light
curve using one of the three default models, trying to get a better fit through
whatever means. In this case, when the Xspec session is ended, the fitted time
breaks from the model parameters will be read out, and used to define spectral
intervals. 

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>If using a standard power-law type model(powerlaw,
bknpower, or bkn2po), and both PC and WT data are used, then all model
parameters must be linked, with the exception of the normalization. If they are
not, the behavior of this task is undefined. Run "help newpar" within Xspec for
more information about linking parameters.

<p>Second, the user can choose to fit a different model to the light curve
data. In this case, the time breaks for the spectral intervals can be manually
entered from the Xspec prompt by running the tcl procedure
<code>set_timebreaks</code> and following the prompts. It should be noted that
the total start and stop times for each mode will define the absolute edges of
the spectral intervals. Any times that are excluded by using the
<code>ignore</code> command in Xspec will be excluded from any and all spectra.
If no time breaks are set using the <code>set_timebreaks</code> procedure, then
there will only be a single interval considered.

<p>Lastly, the user can choose to simply enter the time breaks manually using
the above <code>set_timebreaks</code> procedure, and not fit any model to the
data. Or simply, exit Xspec with no model defined to consider the entire light
curve as the only interval.

<p>In all three of the above cases, GRB flares and any intervals that the user
does not want included in the output spectra, can be excluded using the
<code>ignore</code> command in Xspec.

<p>In the following simple example, the total light curve will be considered as
a single interval, excluding any times before 1000s after the BAT trigger.

<p>No time breaks were set, so the entire light curve is considered a single
interval, but without the first 1000s in either mode.

<p>In the following simple example, the total light curve will be considered as
two intervals, excluding any times before 1000s after the BAT trigger in the
first interval. The first interval will be from 1000s after the trigger to
10000s after the trigger, and the second interval will be from 10000s to the
end of the light curve.

MET Since Trigger, in this context).
