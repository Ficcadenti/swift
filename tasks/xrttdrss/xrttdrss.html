<h2>NAME</h2>
xrttdrss -- Operate on the XRT image and spectra messages from TDRSS. 
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrttdrss  [parameter =<value>] </tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'xrttdrss' processes the XRT image and the spectra generated on-board
soon after a GRB is detected. These data are sent via TDRSS as messages 
and distributed first via the GCN. Because of the real time nature 
of the data, the messages can be processed individually or 
simultaneously by properly setting the input file name parameters.
<br>
<br>
IMAGE: The XRT uses the Image mode when first looks at a new GRB and generates
a postage stamp image. 
The array transmitted contains a subset of the field of view (51x51 pixel)
centered on the GRB position. The array is in RAW coordinates and each pixel 
contains the charge values. During the first 6 months of the mission 
the bias was not subtracted and the charge value in each pixel 
corresponds to the total charge detected. The bias has been subtracted
afterwords. 'xrttdrss' derives sky coordinates and subtracts the bias
when necessary.
It transforms the array from RAW coordinates to detector coordinates 
and adds the WCS keywords in the header to project the image in the sky. 
Note that the image is rotated respect to the celestial north.
The bias is subtracted using a constant value. The bias value was 
derived during pre-launch calibration activities and recorded in a 
calibration file stored in CALDB.
In addition 'xrttdrss' calculates the total flux from the source and the 
error circle on the source position and writes both values in keywords of
the image header.  The source flux is obtained by summing all pixels 
in the array (a region of ~ 4 arcmin) with values bias and gain corrected 
above a threshold set through the parameter 'dnthr'. The flux in ergs/cm2/s is derived 
using a standard conversion factor.
 <!--, corresponding to a CRAB spectrum.--> 
Total flux and conversion factor are written in the keywords 
SRCFLUX and CONVFACT, respectively. The error circle on the position is derived 
by adding in quadrature the contributions of different factors. These are recorded in 
a calibration file included in CALDB. The resulting error circle is written in arcsec 
in the image header keyword ERRCTRD.
<br>
<br>
SPECTRA: After the IMAGE mode, the XRT operates first in the Low Rate 
Photodiode (LR) mode and after switches to the Windowed Timing (WT) mode. 
Two separate spectra are calculated and sent down via TDRSS. The first is in LR, the second is either 
in WT (default) or a cumulative spectrum where LR and WT data are summed together. 

The LR data are taken on-board either with the bias already subtracted (default) or 
the bias not subtracted (obsolete). 'xrttdrss' checks the bias and applies a constant value
if not subtracted on board. The bias subtracted in the spectrum on ground was 
derived during pre-launch calibration activities and recorded in a
calibration file included in CALDB. For the second spectrum, 'xrttdrss' checks first 
if the spectrum contains only WT data or the cumulative LR and WT data.
If the second spectrum contains only WT data no further process is necessary. 
Instead if the spectrum is the sum of the WT and LR, 'xrttdrss' subtracts the first
original LR spectrum to the cumulative (WT and LR) spectrum and recalculates the proper 
exposure for the subtracted spectrum. 
Both spectra are in PHA (not in PI) with 1024 channel (rebinned by a factor of 4 
compared to original PHA array) and they are not background subtracted.
Note: 'xrttdrss' can operate on the second spectrum only after the first was processed. 
'xrttdrss' searches for a temporary file made during the processing of the first
spectrum (an actual copy of that spectrum) and if not found it gives an error.
