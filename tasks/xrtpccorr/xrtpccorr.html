<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtpccorr -- Correct on-ground the bias subtraction for data taken in Photon Counting mode 
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtpccorr [parameter = < value >]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


The bias in the Photon Counting mode is subtracted on-board using the 
bias map taken during each spacecraft slew.
This task, 'xrtpccorr', allows to estimate the on-ground correction on the 
bias value within an observation and to apply bias adjustments if needed.
<br>
The bias can be estimated on-ground using the DN value of the corner 
pixels of grade 0 events, stored in the 3x3 arrays of the PHAS column in the event file. 
For single-pixel events, or some other good grade configurations, the 
corner pixels are below the split threshold and therefore they should 
represent a measure of the residual bias.
<p>
The input file for this task is the unfiltered event file with the bad 
pixels flagged and the event grade assigned 
(after the 'xrtflagpix', 'xrtpcgrade' and 'xrthotpix' processing).
The residual bias calculation accounts for grade, spatial and time dependence.
<p>   
By default the task uses only the events with grade 0 and excludes the bad pixels. 
The parameters 'grademin', 'grademax' and 'badpix'  allow to change these defaults.
<p>
The spatial dependence is accounted by dividing the CCD window in subimages and 
calculating the bias in each subimage. The size of the subimages is input via the 
parameter 'subimgsize'. The task requires to input the source position in sky coordinates. 
This position  is converted in detector coordinates for each time interval having a 
stable attitude. The first subimage is centered on the source position and the 
remaining surrounds the source subimage. The bias calculated in each subimage 
is applied only to the events belonging to that subimage.
Alternatively a single bias value can be calculated using the entire CCD 
window and applied to all pixels. The parameter 'subimage' allows to 
switch between single or multiple bias values.    
<p>
The time dependence is accounted by setting the number of events to be used in 
the residual bias calculation. The number of events is set with the parameter
'nevents'. Note that events from two different orbits are not mixed, therefore 
if there are not sufficient events to have exact 'nevents' per interval, the last
interval within an orbit includes also all the residual events.
<p> 
If the central subimage, within one time interval, contains more than 
'nevents' but an external subimage has less events than requested, the 
value obtained for the central image is used for the whole CCD.
If in all subimages the number of events is less than 'nevents', 
the entire CCD is used for the residual bias estimation.
If the parameter 'lessevents' is set to yes, the procedure described above 
is not followed, the task use instead the events found within each image, 
even if they are less than 'nevents'.
<p> 
The user can choose the method for the calculation: the arithmetic mean of the 
corner pixel values or their median value (parameter 'biasmode' set to 'mean' or 
'median', respectively). The value obtained, representing the residual bias, 
is then subtracted to each DN value of the 3x3 array of the events (stored in the PHAS
column). The bias adjustment is not applied i) to the events coming from the CCD corner sources and 
ii) to the events with RAWX/RAWY values outside the nominal 0-599 range. In this latter case, the 
task also adds/updates to the output event file a keyword named 'XBADFRAM' with value set to 'T'.
<br>
Note that this task is run by 'xrtpcbias', it should not be used individually
(see 'xrtpcbias' help file for details).
