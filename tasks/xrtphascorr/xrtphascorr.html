<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtphascorr -- Re-order the pixel telemetered in the PC PHAS array
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtphascorr [parameter = < value >]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'xrtphascorr' orders the 3x3 pixel array telemetered for the PC mode according to the standard 
configuration defined at launch. The 3x3 array is stored in the PHAS column of the PC mode event data.
<p>
With the version of the on-board software uploaded on 2008-05-29 at 17:58 UT, the DN values of the 3x3 
array were telemetered to ground with a different pixel order compared to the standard one. 
The order of the 3x3 array, as telemetred by this on-board software version and subsequent ones, are recorded in 
the CALDB file 'phasconffile' together with their time of validity.
<p>
This task first checks if the 3x3 array telemetered is ordered according to 
the standard configuration. The check is done by comparing the 3x3 pixel configuration in use at 
the epoch of the observation, as stored in the CALDB file, with the standard one.
<br>
If the 3x3 pixel array is not in the standard configuration, 'xrtphascorr' re-orders 
the 3x3 array. The telemetered 3x3 pixel array before correction is saved unchanged in the column 'TLMPHAS' 
in the output unfiltered event file. The keyword 'XSTDPHAS' is added and set to 'T' to 
indicate that the PHAS column contains the 3x3 array in standard configuration.
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>infile [file name]
<dd>Name of the input event FITS file.
<p>  
<dt>outfile [file name]
<dd>The output file name. The value 'NONE' will cause the input file to be overwritten.
<p>
<dt>(phasconffile = CALDB) [file name]
<dd>Name of the input PHAS configuration file. Type CALDB to use the file in the Calibration Database.
<p>
<dt>(clobber=no) [boolean]
<dd>If set to yes, overwrite the output file.
<p>
<dt>(history=yes) [boolean]
<dd>If set to yes, write parameter values and other information in HISTORY blocks.
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer]
<dd>Chatter Level (min=0, max=5).
</dl>    
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<ol>
<li> Correct, if needed, the order of the PHAS array of the input event file which is overwritten in output:
<p>
<pre> > xrtphascorr infile=sw00050400062xpcw3po_uf.evt outfile=NONE
</pre> 
</ol>
