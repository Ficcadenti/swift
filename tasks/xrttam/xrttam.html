<h2>NAME</h2>
xrttam -- Calculate corrections to the attitute file using parameters from the TAM device.


<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrttam  hdfile outdir [parameter = <value>] </tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
'xrttam'  calculates the corrections to the attitude file using parameters
derived from the Telescope Alignment Monitor (TAM) device by running in sequence
'det2att' and 'attcombine'.
The corrected attitute is applied to the XRT event data to transform the 
 detector coordinates of the XRT instrument in sky position. After this 
correction the  reconstructed XRT sky positions have an accuracy of few arcsecs.

</br>
The TAM device on-board Swift monitors the alignment between the XRT focal 
plane camera and the optical axis of the mirror system.
The TAM system consists of a redundant pair of LEDs mounted near the XRT
focal plane, an optical assembly, a mirror on the Star tracker subsystem
and an optical camera which records two images, one directly reflected by the 
optical assembly, the other reflected by a mirror on the Star tracker 
subsystem.
</br>
The first image, the Primary TAM image, records the movement of the focal plane.
The second image, the Star tracker image, is sensitive to both the Star tracker 
boresight and the XRT boresight,
so that it is necessary to subtract the offset of the Primary image from the 
offset of the Star tracker image to isolate the contribution 
from the Star tracker boresight.
Changes in the TAM centroid positions are related to distortions of 
the position of a photon on the CCD.
To obtain the correct position of an event on the XRT and then in sky
coordinates, the information obtained by the TAM device must be taken into 
account.
The coordinates of the two image centroids on the TAM camera (included
in the housekeeping data) are compared to the LED reference positions on the TAM 
(stored in the CALDB) 
in order to detect either distortions of the XRT structure or
offsets induced by the Star tracker movements. The LEDs reference positions 
can be provided also by the user through the parameters
'tamrefx1', 'tamrefy1','tamrefx2', 'tamrefy2'.
<p>

'xrttam' translates the offsets of the TAM images into corrections to 
the detector coordinates on the XRT. These corrections are stored in a 
FITS file ('outtamfile') containing three columns with TIME, delta DETX and 
delta DETY information.
The corrections to the detector coordinates are then transformed in 
corrections to the attitude, running the task 'det2att'.
The 'det2att' output and the original attitude file are combined using 
the task 'attcombine' producing a corrected attitude file. 
The latter is applied to the event file when calculating sky position of the
events (X and Y coordinates). 
The keyword 'XRTTAM' set to 'T' is added to the output corrected attitude file 
to prevent from applying the TAM correction more than once.
