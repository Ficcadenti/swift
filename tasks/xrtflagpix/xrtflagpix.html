<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtflagpix - Flags events for bad pixels and calibration source location.
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtflagpix infile outfile  [parameter = <value>] </tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
'xrtflagpix' flags events occurring in bad pixels and bad column locations, 
events associated with the corner calibration sources and, depending on the CCD temperature, 
events on pixels located on the burned spots region (42 columns and 54 rows whose lower left corner 
is RAWX=307, RAWY=256). 
Only event files from the Swift XRT modes with positional information, 
Photon Counting (PC) and Windowed Timing (WT) are processed. 
Note that, for the WT mode only bad columns are defined and therefore flagged. 
Moreover, for PC Mode data, events whose central pixel in the 3x3 
neighborhood has a PHA value (PHAS[1]) below a certain threshold are flagged. 
If the parameter 'thrfile' is set to CALDB, 'xrtflagpix' reads the threshold 
value stored in the calibration database file.
By setting 'thrfile' to NONE, the task allows the user to set this 
threshold using the parameter 'phas1thr'. 
<p>
'xrtflapix' allows for three different input files that identify bad pixels.
These are: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>the Bad Pixels calibration file which includes the most up to date
information about known bad pixels,
<li>the on-board Bad Pixels Table that includes
the list of bad pixels used on-board for that observation and
<li>a user supplied list of bad pixels (this file has to be of the same format 
as the CALDB bad pixels file). 
</ol>
<p>
In the PC mode, events are flagged bad if any of the 3x3 neighborhood pixels are recognized
as saturated by the on-board computer. 
For this mode the user must provide in input also the Housekeeping Header 
Packet file (parameter 'hdfile') to consider the bad pixels flagged on-board 
which are not present in the on-ground Bad Pixels CALDB files.
<br>
In the WT mode a column is flagged also if at least one of its nearby columns is 
bad.
<p>
The CCD has four calibration sources located at the corners of the detector.
Events coming from these positions are flagged to allow for their identification
during the screening. Also the events outside of the field of view of the instrument
(FOV) are flagged.
The locations of the calibration sources and the geometry of the FOV 
are read from a CALDB file specified through the parameter 'srcfile'. 
<p>
The user has an option to choose which bad pixel list to use. 
All events are checked and flagged using the information obtained from 
the input bad pixels files. 
The bad pixels files contain a column 'TIME' including the mission elapsed time 
at which the pixel is first considered as bad. The task reads the 'TIME' column and, 
for a given observation, considers only the pixels identified as bad before the 
observation start date.
The event flag is stored as a 16 bit binary number 
in the column STATUS. The flag, recorded in the column STATUS, 
indicates if the event is considered good or bad. If the event is bad the 
flag indicates why (for example  dead or hot pixel) and also the origin 
of the information (e.g. if the bad pixel was stored in the CALDB file or 
the on-board Bad Pixels Table).
The keyword XRTFLAG is added in the output file by the task.
<p>    
The list of flags is the following:
<blockquote>  
Events STATUS flags 
<blockquote>    
<li>b0000000000000000    Good event
<li>b0000000000000001    Event falls in a bad pixel from CALDB 
<li>b0000000000000010    Event falls in a bad pixel from on-board Bad Pixels Table  
<li>b0000000000000100    Event falls in a pixel at the location of the burned spots
<li>b0000000000001000    Event falls in hot bad pixel 
<li>b0000000000010000    Event falls in a user bad pixel
<li>b0000000000100000    Event falls in flickering bad pixels
<li>b0000000001000000    Event falls in a saturated pixel of the current observation                     
<li>b0000000010000000    Event has a neighbor hot or flickering
<li>b0000000100000000    Event falls in a bad column
<li>b0000001000000000    Event has PHAS[1] < Event Threshold
<li>b0000010000000000    Event has a neighbor bad from bad pixels list 
<li>b0000100000000000    Event out of FOV or out of detector boundaries
<li>b0001000000000000    Event from calibration source 1                     
<li>b0010000000000000    Event from calibration source 2                     
<li>b0100000000000000    Event from calibration source 3  
<li>b1000000000000000    Event from calibration source 4  
</blockquote>        
</blockquote>    
<p>
    Each event will be associated with a value that is a combination of more 
    than one of the STATUS flags listed above. For example, if an event falls 
    in a single pixel marked as bad in the calibration bad pixels file and 
    also in the on-board Bad Pixels Table, the event flag will be: 
    b0000000000100011.
<br>
If the parameter 'overstatus' is set to 'yes' (default) the STATUS column is overwritten. To update 
the STATUS column, without erasing the values of the previous 'xrtflagpix' run, the user must set to 
'no' the 'overstatus' parameter.
<p>    
    All bad pixels are stored in an extension of the output file. If this already 
    exists and the parameter 'overstatus' is set to 'no', the extension is updated with
    new bad pixels. If requested by the user the bad pixel table is written 
    in a separate output file.    
    The bad pixels extension or output file contains the following columns: RAWX and RAWY
    give the raw coordinates of the pixel; Amp including the amplifier
    number; 
    TYPE which identifies whether it is a single pixel (1), a column (2) or a row 
    (3).For columns and rows of bad  pixels, RAWX and RAWY indicate the start pixel
    and YEXTENT the length of the set of consecutive bad pixels included in 
    the bad pixels file; 
    BADFLAG stores a 16 bit binary number which indicates the origin of the 
    bad pixel with the following meaning:
<blockquote>    
Bad pixels BADFLAG flags 
<blockquote>    
<li>b0000000000000001   Bad pixels from CALDB 
<li>b0000000000000010   Bad pixels from on-board Bad Pixels Table
<li>b0000000000000100   Pixels at the location of the burned spots
<li>b0000000000010000   Bad pixels in the file provided by the user
