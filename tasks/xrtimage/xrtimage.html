<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtimage -- Evaluate bias and clean bad pixels in XRT Imaging Mode data.
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtimage infile outfile [parameter=<value>]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'xrtimage' calculates the bias, cleans the bad 
and the saturated pixels (parameter 'cleanbp' = yes), and  eliminates the calibration 
sources ('cleansrc' = yes) for the data taken in the Swift XRT Image mode. 
In this mode, pixel values are proportional to the charge collected in the pixel,
not to the number of events. 
</br>
The Swift XRT Image data are stored using the FITS Image extension. If multiple 
exposures (frames) are taken within an observation, these are included in a single file 
where each extension correspond to a single frame. 'xrtimage' processes all the extensions.
It is possible to exclude frames by screening ('gtiscreen'=yes)  the file for an input GTI
file specified in the parameter 'gtifile'.
<p>
With the old version of the on-board software (before v. 8.9), in the Swift XRT image mode 
the bias is not subtracted on board. For the files produced in that epoch,
the bias can be subtracted on ground using a single value valid for all pixels
of the CCD. The  bias value has been evaluated from ground calibration data and it is
stored in a CALDB file. This file is periodically updated by the result 
analysis of flight calibration data. The bias value can be input in two ways: 
as a single value specified through the parameter 'bias' 
or, if the parameter 'bias' is set to a negative value, the task will 
read the bias value information stored in the file specified 
through the parameter 'biasfile'.
If the 'biasfile' parameter is set to CALDB (default) the latest version of the 
bias file stored in Calibration Database will be used. As an alternative, the user 
can input their own bias file (with the same format of the CALDB file).
The bias file can contain more than one row, each corresponding to bias 
measurements at different epochs. The value applied to the data
is the result of bias values measured at epochs closest to the time of observation.
<p>
With the new version of the on-board software (v. 8.9) the bias can be subtracted 
on-board and the 
bias value subtracted to each frame is telemetred together with the last twenty pixels of 
the frame and stored in the housekeeping header file.
If the parameter 'subbias' is set to yes, the ground software estimates the bias and
if necessary adjusts the bias subtraction. In fact, for each frame the bias is estimated 
by calculating the median value of the twenty pixels 
telemetred and, if the bias value obtained differs from the one subtracted on-board more 
than a quantity set by the user through the parameter 'biasdiff', the bias correction is 
adjusted.
The parameters 'bias' and 'biasfile' are not considered by the task in this latter case.
<p>
To clean bad and saturated pixels (if parameter 'cleanbp' = yes) 'xrtimage'
allows three different input bad pixels list file that identify bad pixels 
similarly to 'xrtflagpix'. These are:
<ol>
<li> the Bad pixels calibration file which includes the most up to date
 information about known bad pixels,
<li>  the on-board Bad pixels that includes the list of bad pixels
used on-board for that observation and
<li> a user-supplied list of bad pixels (this file has to be of the same
format as the bad pixels file in CALDB)
</ol>
The CCD has four calibration sources located at the corners of the detector.
Pixels overlapping with calibration sources location are flagged. The location
of the calibration sources are read from a CALDB file specified in the parameter
'srcfile'. 
</br>
It is possible to flag, depending on the CCD temperature, 
pixels located on the burned spots region (42 columns and 54 rows whose lower left corner 
is RAWX=307, RAWY=256). 
<p>
The output file always maintains the structure of the input file and three keywords are
added or  updated in the file headers.
The first,'XRTPHACO',  is set to 'T' to indicate that the bias correction was done, the second, 
'BIAS_VAL',contains the bias value which has been subtracted, and the last,'XRTBPCNT', 
stores the total number of bad and saturated pixels removed.

'xrtimage' can be run more than once on an input file.
If the input file has been already processed (XRTPHACO is set to 'T'), the task 
adds to all pixels the bias value previously subtracted (stored in the 
keyword 'BIAS_VAL') before applying the new bias correction. 
<p>
The bad and saturated pixels are set to NULL in the image array.
The bad and saturated pixels cleaned by 'xrtimage' can be output in a file 
by specifying the filename in the parameter 'outbpfile'. This file contains as many extensions 
as the input file and each extension lists the raw coordinates of each pixel removed from 
the relative image and a flag recording why that pixel has been removed. 
The flag is a 16 bit binary number and the values are defined in the 
'xrtflagpix' helpfile.
