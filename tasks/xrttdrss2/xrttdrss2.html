<h2>NAME</h2>
xrttdrss2 -- Process XRT TDRSS Images and Photon Counting Mode messages. 
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrttdrss2  imfile  pcfile [parameter =< value >] </tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This routine processes some of the XRT TDRSS products generated
after a Swift automatic slew on a new GRB detected.
The products are: a) All the exposures (up to three) in Image mode
taken by XRT after the slew to a new GRB. These images are used to 
calculate an on-board centroid and generate a postage stamp.
b) The PC mode single pixel events of the first snapshot 
taken when a new GRB is acquired as automatic target.

<p>
IMAGES:<p>
The processing applied to each image includes: flagging of the 
bad pixels and calibration sources, subtracting the bias if necessary 
and transforming the images from RAW to SKY.
The RAW to SKY transformation uses the attitude information stored 
as an extension of the image. The attitude is derived from the Image 
packed header also stored as a separate extension in the image file.

<p>
PHOTON COUNTING:<p>
The processing applied to the events includes: flagging of the bad pixels and 
calibration sources recorded in the STATUS column, calculating 
the values for the DETX/Y and X/Y columns and cleaning the bad events.  
The attitude information to derive the X and Y position is stored as an extension 
of the event file. This is derived from the PC mode packed header also 
stored as a separate extension in the event file. 

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>imfile [file name]
<dd>
Name of the input TDRSS image file. Type 'NONE' to not process the image file.
It is expected the file to be uncompressed.
<p>        
<dt>pcfile [file name]
<dd>
Name of the input TDRSS photon counting file. Type 'NONE' to not process the image file. 
It is expected the file to be uncompressed.
<p>        
<dt>attfile [file name]
<dd>
Name of the input attitude file. Type 'NONE' to use attitude information
 in the input file (extension ATTITUDE). 
<p>        
<dt>(outimfile) [file name]
<dd>
Name of the output TDRSS image file. Type DEFAULT to use standard naming convention
<p>
<dt>(outpcfile) [file name]
<dd>
Name of the output TDRSS Photon Counting file. Type DEFAULT to use standard naming convention
<p>
<dt>(cleanbp=yes) [boolean]
<dd> Clean input files for bad pixels. If this flag is set to yes, the event file have the 
bad pixels removed.
<p>
<dt>(subimbias=no) [boolean]
<dd> Subtract bias from image input file? If set to 'yes', the task subtracts the bias 
value stored in CALDB only if non subtracted on-board.
<p>
<dt>(maxtemp=0.0) [real]
<dd> Temperature threshold to flag burned spot
<p>
<dt>(method=AREA) [string]
<dd> Image transform method (enumlist=[AREA|CENTER|EVENTS|INTENSITY|DEFAULT])
<p>
<dt>(teldef) [file name]
<dd> Name of the telescope definition file or CALDB 
<p>
<dt>(cleanup=no) [boolean]
<dd>If 'cleanup'=yes the temporary file will be deleted
<p>
<dt>(interpolation=CONSTANT) [boolean]
<dd> Attitude interpolation method
<p>
<dt>(clobber=no) [boolean]
<dd>If 'clobber'=yes and outfile=filename, the file with the same name
will be overwritten if it exists.
<p>
<dt>(history=yes) [boolean]
<dd>If setto'yes', write parameter values and other information in HISTORY keywords.
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 3) [integer]
<dd>Chatter Level (min=0, max=5)
</dl>    
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<ol>
<li> Process XRT TDRSS Image mode message xrt_raw_threshpix.fits and generates the output file image_out.img:
<p>    
<pre>xrttdrss2 outimfile=image_out.img chatter=5 
          imfile=xrt_raw_threshpix.fits pcfile=NONE </pre>
