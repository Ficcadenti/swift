<h2>NAME</h2>
xrtph2br -- Calculates a single PHA value and assigns event grade.
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>xrtph2br infile outfile [parameter=value ... ]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
This task processes SWIFT XRT Photon Counting mode event files, 
calculates a single PHA value and assigns event grade.
<p>
In the Photon Counting Mode each event has associated nine PHA values, stored 
in the column PHAS, corresponding to the central pixel and to the eight 
surrounding pixels.
The  task reads the PHAS column with the 9 elements, calculates a 
single value for the event PHA and writes it in the PHA column of
the output file. The computation of the PHA is done summing up all the PHA
 values of the pixels above split threshold. The grade values assigned by
the routine are written in the column GRADE of the output file. 
The number of pixels above the split threshold, considered in the computation 
of the PHA value, is stored in the column named PixsAbove.  
The grade values are assigned  following the XMM pattern  
definition. A file with the definition of the grade values has been 
included in the CALDB.
The input event file can be supplied in the compressed format except for the
case of outfile=NONE  when the input file should be overwritten.
All other columns of the EVENTS extension and the GTI extension of the input 
file will be copied unchanged to the output file.
<p> 
The task allows also to assign grades following the ASCA convention if the
option 'ascagrade' is set to 'yes'.In this
case the computation is done using the routine  originally  developed for the 
ASCA task 'faint', so it is dependent on the ASCA convention of 
'grade' description. The routine ignores the corner pixels in the computation 
of the PHA value, except in the case of grade 6 where a corner pixel is 
included.
The results of this computation are included in the two columns ASCAPHA and 
ASCAGRADE. This option is included only for comparison purposes and if
selected both the XMM and ASCA grades are included in the output file.
Grade selection of the data should be derived using the XMM pattern
convention.
The keywords of the Data Subspace convention (DS keywords) recording
the event grade values present in the file (DSVALn, DSTYPn, DSFORMn ),
 are added to the file. These keywords are updated by other tasks 
for recording the screening eventually performed.
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>infile [file name]
<dd>The  FITS  file name from which the photon counting 
PHAS column must be read.
<p>    
<dt>outfile [file name]
<dd>The new FITS file with the PHA, GRADE and PixsAbove  columns filled. If 'NONE' is input, the input file will be overwritten.
<p>    
<dt>(gradefile = CALDB )[file name]
<dd>Name of input GRADE file. Input 'CALDB' (default) to get calibration file.
<p>
<dt>(split = 40) [integer]
<dd>The split threshold level desired. If set to a negative value the on board split threshold 
(read from the input file keyword 'SPLITTHR') is used.
<p>
<dt>(ascagrade = no) [boolean]
<dd>Calculate the grades according with the ASCA pattern? The results will be
written in the 'ASCAPHA' and 'ASCAGRADE' new columns 
<p>
<dt>(history=yes) [boolean]
<dd>Write parameter values and other information in HISTORY blocks.
<p>
<dt>(clobber=no) [boolean]
<dd>If 'clobber'=yes and outfile=filename, the file with the same name
will be  overwritten if it exists.
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer]
<dd>Verbosity Level from 0 to 5
</dl>    
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<ol>
<li>Calculate PHA and GRADE values for a Photon counting mode event file, write the
 output in the file 'outfile.fits'  and use the maximum verbosity level.
