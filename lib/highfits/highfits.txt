 *
 *	DESCRIPTION:
 *		This module provides a collection of high-level routines to the FITSIO
 *		library for creating, reading, and modifying FITS files.
 *
 *	EXPORTED FUNCTIONS:
 *
 *	Functions that use the FITSIO library:
 *
 *		OpenFitsFile		--- open existing FITS file in R/O or R/W mode
 *		OpenWriteFitsFile	--- create new FITS file
 *		CloseFitsFile		--- close FITS file
 *		WriteComment		--- write comment record(s) to FITS file
 *		WriteHistory		--- write history record(s) to FITS file
 *		FinishPrimaryHeader	--- write primary header out to disk
 *		FinishBintableHeader--- write Bintable header out to disk
 *		WriteHeader			--- write header to disk
 *		WriteUpdatedHeader	--- re-write header to disk
 *		WriteBintable		--- write block of Bintable rows to disk
 *		WriteFastBintable	--- same as `WriteBintable' but faster
 *		ReadBintable		--- read block of Bintable rows from disk
 *		WriteWholeBintable	--- write Bintable to disk
 *		KeyWordMatch		--- check if header keyword has certain value
 *		RetrieveFitsHeader	--- read FITS header from disk into memory
 *		ReadImage			--- read FITS primary array into memory
 *
 *	Function that work independently from FITSIO
 *
 *		EmpytHeader			--- create an empty FITS header
 *		ExistsKeyWord		--- check wether header contains certain keyword
 *		GetLVal				--- retrieve boolean value from header
 *		GetSVal				--- retrieve string value from header
 *		GetJVal				--- retrieve integer value from header
 *		GetDVal				--- retrieve double value from header
 *		GetComment			--- retrieve comment fields of header card
 *		SetLVal				--- set boolean value in header
 *		SetSVal				--- set string value in header
 *		SetJVal				--- set integer value in header
 *		SetDVal				--- set double value in header
 *		SetComment			--- define comment field of header card
 *		InsertCard			--- insert card in FITS header at specified place
 *		MoveCards			--- move header cards
 *		AddCard				--- add a new card to FITS header
 *		AddComHis			--- add comment or history card to FITS header
 *		AddComment			--- add comment record(s) to FITS header
 *		AddHistory			--- add history record(s) to FITS header
 *		AddColumn			--- add new column to Bintable
 *		ChangeColumn		--- modify column in Bintable
 *		DeleteCard			--- delete card from FITS header
 *		DeleteComment		--- delete comment record(s) from FITS header
 *		NewPrimaryHeader	--- create empty FITS primary header in memory
 *		EndPrimaryHeader	--- finish building primary FITS header
 *		NewBintableHeader	--- create empty Bintable header in memory
 *		GetBintableStructure--- figure out structure of Bintable
 *		EndBintableHeader	--- finish building Bintable header
 *		ColNameMatch		--- check if column with certain name exists
 *		RowCp				--- copy Bintable rows
 *		RowIllegal			--- fill current row with 'illegal' values
 *		GetColNameIndx		--- get Bintable column index
 *		ColIndices			--- `GetColNameIndx' for multiple columns
 *		ReleaseBintable		--- free memory allocated with Bintable data
 *		ReleaseImage		--- free memory allocated by previous ReadImage
 *
